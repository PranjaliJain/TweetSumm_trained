# `"What is in a Tweet?"`
Performing abstractive summarization on dialogue-based texts poses several potential challenges to SOTA deep-learning techniques, which are tested primarily on single-author texts. I compare the performance of three SOTA pre-trained abstractive text summarization models on the TweetSum (He et al., 2020) dataset. Final project for CIS6390: Special Topics in Computing.
